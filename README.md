As the title say, with this plugin for Comicrack you could translate the content of the "summary" field of the metadata of the comic
to your language. Normally when you scrape the metadata with Comicvine, Bedetheque, Bonelli, FromDucks or any other scrapper plugin you have, the content could be not in you language. 
Beacuse i only know a little English, and i want to know about the comic before reading it. I do this plugin to translate this field.

As the translation is done by Google, you have to be careful not to go through a large number of comics at once to avoid being banned.

I am not going to do as other developers do and include the necessary libraries inside plugin. What I have done is download python 2.7.0 from:
https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7/Python-2.7.tgz. 
Then unzip it and copy the "Lib" directory hanging under the comicrack installation directory which in my case is "C:\Program Files\Comicrack"

I know other plugin developers don't like this solution, but I think that's a topic for discussion in another forum.
The truth is that I have tried it and it works correctly.

If anybody want to include the libraries and deploy the plugin with it, it's free to do it.

I hope you find it useful and it makes your life easier.
